# gem package -- medusa_rest_client

A series of Ruby interfaces to Medusa

# Description

A series of Ruby interfaces to Medusa.  This gem is a client for
interacting with [Medusa](https://github.com/misasa/medusa) by REST.  [Medusa REST API](http://dream.misasa.okayama-u.ac.jp/documentation/MedusaRestAPI) follows
the Rails's RESTful conventions, so this gem uses [ActiveResource](https://github.com/rails/activeresource)
to interact with the Medusa REST API.  This gem allows Ruby developers
to programmatically  access the API and provides some useful functions
to manage records on the Medusa programmatically.

This package is referred by [gem package -- sisyphus-for-medusa](https://github.com/misasa/sisyphus-for-medusa).
